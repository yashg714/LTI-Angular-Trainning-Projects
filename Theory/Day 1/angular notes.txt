What is a Component?
A component is basically a class which has properties(fields) and behaviour(method). A component class must be annotated with
@Component decorator(annotation) just above the class.
@Component indicates that the class below is a component. It contains metadata.
It contains following 3 properties:
1. selector: a custom tag <></>
2. 
   template: directly write HTML code.
   templateUrl: link to a separate HTML file.
3. 
  style: directly write CSS code.
  StyleUrl: link to a separate CSS file.


import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'FirstApp';
}


//Inline template & inline style:
ng g c sample -it -is --skip-tests

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: '<div>this is div</div>',
  style: 'div{color:red}'
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'FirstApp';
}





--App Module
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';

import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent,
    HomeComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }

declarations: All components which you have created in your application, must be added in the declaration section.

imports: All system modules and user modules must be added in the imports section.

providers: All services must be added in providers.

bootstrap: It contains the name of the component which you want to run first.Also known as bootstrap component.

-- to create user component
ng g c home
   OR
ng generate component home

---------------Data Binding---------------

1. One way binding: Also know as Interpolation.
  The flow in interpolation is from 
  component(ts) to view(html).
For User it is read only data.

2. Property Binding: is used to bind the values of component properties to HTML element property.
When you are working with non-string values like
boolean to set the property value of an HTML element, use property binding.

html elements and their properties:
img --->src
div ---> innerText/innerHTML
form --> action
button--> disable,value
a --->href
